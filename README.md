# Hackintosh configuration for Lenovo ThinkPad E580

Tested on 20KS003AXS model with macOS Mojave (10.14)

Everything seems to be working except:
* Native Wi-Fi (Intel AC 3165)
* Most of the FN keys (Volume +/- works)
* Discrete graphics card (ATI Radeon RX 550)
* Fingerprint sensor
    
Minor glitches for battery status is observed from time to time (empty or red battery icon while 100% charge)
